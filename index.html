            <h3>BSc Computer Science Student.</h3>
            <p>I am an enthusiastic and driven student at the University of Hull.
                I've honed my software skills through coursework and personal projects.
                I am looking to further my development in the field as I prepare for my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
                See below for a detailed overview of me and my achievements.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As a third-year Computer Science student pursuing an MEng degree at Hull University, 
                my academic journey is fueled by a passion for technology and a commitment to innovation. Beyond algorithms, 
                I have a deep-rooted joy of physical fitness. As a dedicated gym enthusiast, I cherish the discipline and 
                resilience cultivated through weightlifting and strength training. When not immersed in lines of code or pushing 
                personal limits in the gym, you'll likely find me pounding the pavement; running serves as a mental escape and a source of physical rejuvenation. 
                Additionally, my love for American football runs deep, serving as a dynamic outlet for teamwork, strategy, and sheer adrenaline. 
                With a balanced pursuit of both intellectual challenges and physical endeavours, I strive to embody a holistic approach to personal growth and fulfilment.

                <h3>Live Stock Market Webscraper and Trading Practice Tool. C#</h3>
                <p>This project involves developing an application that leverages web scraping
                    to collect historical stock data and live prices for select tech stocks. Users
                    can engage in simulated trading within a practice account, where they can buy and sell
                    stocks to build their portfolio using real-time evaluations. The application provides
                    candlestick charts for visualising stock trends and facilitating a virtual trading environment
                    where users can hone their investment skills without risking real money.

                <h3>AI Models Designed to Predict House Prices From the Ames Housing Dataset. Python</h3>
                <p>This project involves predicting future house prices using various regression models, such as 
                    linear regression, polynomial regression, neural networks, and random forest. Initially, the
                    dataset undergoes preparation steps, including data cleaning, feature selection, and normalisation 
                    to ensure its suitability for training the models. The dataset is split into training and testing data
                    to assess their performances accurately and ensure the models generalise well to unseen data and do not
                    overfit. These models are then executed to learn the relationship between house features and prices. Finally, each performance 
                    is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error and mean absolute error, providing insights into 
                    their predictive accuracy and suitability for forecasting house prices.

                <h3>Efficiency Focused Route Finding Algorithm For A Complex Data Structure. C++</h3>
                <p>This project involves building an adjacency list data structure to represent a network of places where each
                    place is linked to its adjacent places using pointers. Using this data structure, various functions are 
                    implemented, including breath-first-search for finding the shortest route, route validation to ensure adherence
                    to specific criteria and limitations, and distance calculation between places. This allows efficient
                    traversal of the network and facilitates route planning and analysis within a large geographic area.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Paramount importance is placed on optimising the efficiency of the algorithms within the context of the extensive network.
                    Through meticulous algorithmic design, data structure selection, and code optimization techniques, the project 
                    endeavours to minimize computational complexity and resource utilisation while staying 100% accurate.
